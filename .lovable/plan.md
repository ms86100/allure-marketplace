# Smart Phone-Native Capabilities — Final Audit Status

## Status: COMPLETE (All Phases A–I Implemented + CI Pipeline + Silent Push Optimization)

All 9 phases are fully implemented. Phase I Live Activities now includes automated CI build pipeline via Codemagic.

## Silent Push Optimization: COMPLETE

### What It Does
Reduces push notification noise for mid-flow order statuses when Live Activity is already tracking the order on the lock screen. In-app notification history and badge counts are always preserved.

### Notification Matrix

| Status | Push? | Live Activity? | Rationale |
|--------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| `accepted` | ✅ Always | Yes | Critical — order confirmed |
| `preparing` | 🔇 Silent | Yes | Mid-flow, Live Activity handles it |
| `ready` | ✅ Always | Yes | Pickup moment — user must know |
| `picked_up` | 🔇 Silent | Yes | Mid-flow tracking |
| `on_the_way` | 🔇 Silent | Yes | Mid-flow tracking |
| `arrived` | 🔇 Silent | Yes | Live Activity shows on lock screen |
| `delivered` | ✅ Always | Yes | Critical endpoint |
| `completed` | ✅ Always | No | Critical endpoint |
| `cancelled` | ✅ Always | No | Critical — must alert |
| All service/booking | ✅ Always | No | No Live Activity for these |

### Implementation

1. **DB column**: `category_status_flows.silent_push` (boolean, default false)
2. **DB trigger**: `fn_enqueue_order_status_notification` includes `silent_push` in notification payload
3. **Edge function**: `process-notification-queue` skips APNs/FCM delivery when `silent_push = true`, but still inserts `user_notifications` for in-app history

## Phase I Live Activities — CI Pipeline Status

### Codemagic Build Pipeline: COMPLETE

Both `ios-release` and `release-all` workflows now include:

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| Copy native plugin files | Copies `LiveActivityPlugin.swift` + `LiveDeliveryActivity.swift` into `ios/App/App/` and adds to App target via xcodeproj |
| Create Widget Extension | Programmatically creates `LiveDeliveryWidgetExtension` target using Ruby xcodeproj gem |
| ActivityKit entitlements | Adds `com.apple.developer.activitykit` to both App and widget extension entitlements |
| NSSupportsLiveActivities | Sets `NSSupportsLiveActivities = true` in Info.plist |
| Deployment target 16.1 | All targets set to iOS 16.1 (required for ActivityKit) |
| Widget signing | Fetches signing files for `app.sociva.community.LiveDeliveryWidget` |
| Plugin registration | AppDelegate registers `LiveActivityPlugin` with `#available(iOS 16.1, *)` guard |
| IPA validation | Verifies widget extension `.appex` exists in final IPA |

### Codemagic Requirements (User Action)

In App Store Connect, register the widget extension bundle ID:
- `app.sociva.community.LiveDeliveryWidget`

### Runtime Call Chain (Verified)

```
Order status change → useLiveActivity hook → LiveActivityManager.push()
  → LiveActivity.startLiveActivity/update/end → Native Plugin Bridge → iOS ActivityKit
  → On web: silent no-op
```
