## Fixed Bugs (18/20)

| # | Bug | Fix | Status |
|---|-----|-----|--------|
| 1 | `failed` in terminal statuses causing 400 | Removed + `22P02` error handling in `ActiveOrderStrip` | ✅ |
| 2 | `delivered` conflicting `is_terminal` | DB updated: `is_terminal=true` for seller_delivery `delivered` | ✅ |
| 3 | Color dot invalid CSS | Uses `className` with Tailwind class splitting | ✅ |
| 4 | Wrong column `logo_url` | Changed to `profile_image_url` in edge function | ✅ |
| 5 | `stalled_notified` never resets | Resets on movement >100m | ✅ |
| 6 | Proximity misses `at_gate` | Added to status list | ✅ |
| 7 | Delay detection misses `on_the_way` | Added to status list | ✅ |
| 8 | Throttle drops final update | `doUpdate` guard: `if (!this.active.has(...))` | ✅ |
| 9 | Inconsistent transit status lists | Unified defaults with `at_gate` | ✅ |
| 10 | `en_route` dead code | Removed from defaults | ✅ |
| 12 | Sync/heartbeat divergence | Both use terminal-exclusion via `getTerminalStatuses()` | ✅ |
| 15 | APNs priority always 10 | `isTerminal ? "10" : "5"` | ✅ |
| 18 | `delivered` in START_STATUSES | Excluded from `getStartStatuses()` | ✅ |
| 19 | Hardcoded MAX_ETA=45 | Dynamic from `initialEtaMinutes`, 15m default | ✅ |
| 20 | Inconsistent quoting in filters | Standardized quoted values | ✅ |
| 14 | Polling cold start | Accepted — harmless extra sync | ✅ |
| 17 | en_route dedup | Accepted — more conservative approach | ✅ |

## Accepted Limitations (2/20)

| # | Bug | Limitation |
|---|-----|-----------|
| 11 | Realtime delivery channel no filter | Postgres `eq` filter applied for single-order case. For 2+ concurrent orders, Supabase Realtime does not support `in` filters on channels — client-side filtering via `activeOrderIdsRef` remains the mitigation. Acceptable until ~100 concurrent deliveries. |
| 13 | AnimatePresence ref warning | Cosmetic — `motion.div` elements support refs natively. Warning likely from sibling component. No functional impact. |
